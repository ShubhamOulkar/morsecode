    <h1>Morse Code</h1>
    <p>Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized 
      sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs.
      International Morse code encodes the 26 basic Latin letters a through z, one accented Latin
      letter (é), the Arabic numerals, and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns). 
      There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters. Each Morse code symbol is formed 
      by a sequence of dits and dahs. The dit duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse 
      code transmission. The duration of a dah is three times the duration of a dit. Each dit or dah 
      within an encoded character is followed by a period of signal absence, called a space, equal to 
      the dit duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to three dits,
      and words are separated by a space equal to seven dits.
    </p>
    <p>Morse code can be memorized and sent in a form perceptible to the human senses, e.g. via sound 
      waves or visible light, such that it can be directly interpreted by persons trained in the skill.
      Morse code is usually transmitted by on-off keying of an information-carrying medium such as electric 
      current, radio waves, visible light, or sound waves. The current or wave is present during the time 
      period of the dit or dah and absent during the time between dits and dahs
    </p>
    <p >
      To increase the efficiency of encoding, Morse code was originally designed so that the length of each
      symbol is approximately inverse to the frequency of occurrence of the character that it represents in 
      text of the English language. Thus the most common letter in English, the letter e, has the shortest 
      code a single dit. Because the Morse code elements are specified by proportion rather than specific 
      time durations, the code is usually transmitted at the highest rate that the receiver is capable of 
      decoding. Morse code transmission rate (speed) is specified in groups per minute, commonly referred 
      to as words per minute.
